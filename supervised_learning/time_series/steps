# Data Preprocessing (Handle missing values, scaling, etc.)
# Feature Engineering (Create additional relevant features)
# Sequence Creation (Prepare sequences for LSTM)

# Train-Validation Split
# Build LSTM Model using libraries like TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch

# Train the LSTM Model
# Evaluate the Model on Validation Set
# Tune Hyperparameters if necessary
# Predict on Test Data (if available)

# Evaluate Model Performance (metrics like RMSE, MAE, etc.)
# Fine-tune Model if needed
